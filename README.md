# REST API - template

For who ?

This template is made for developers who are involved in REST API projects.

Why ?

Starting from scratch consumes time, which could be used for coding, but it's not the main point of this template. The main point is that your REST APIs will be standardized, so it gives you a flexibility when rotating between projects.

I do not like the way you did this ... Can I contribute ?

This repo is open for any improvments and discussion.
